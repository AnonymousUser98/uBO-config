This is the uBlock Origin configuration that I'd recommend for most users. Advanced users should also check the _I am an advanced user_ checkbox and set `filterAuthorMode` to `true`.

To apply this configuration, open the uBO dashboard, go to the _Settings_ tab, and click the `Restore from file...` button at the bottom of the page. In the file picker window that appears, select the `ublock-origin-config.txt` file that you downloaded from this repo.
